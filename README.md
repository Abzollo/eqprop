# Equilibrium Propagation
A reimplementation of [Equilibrium Propagation: Bridging the Gap Between Energy-Based Models and Backpropagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179). One version uses automatic differentiation with PyTorch, the other doesn't (still uses PyTorch though). There is a graph version as well (i.e. no tensors), but it is much slower.

Soon to be added:
[Generalization of Equilibrium Propagation to Vector Field Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04873).
